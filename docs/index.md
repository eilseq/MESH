# MESH Studio Guide

Welcome to MESH, a browser-based p5.js playground built for remix-driven creative coding. This site collects the user-facing documentation you can publish via GitHub Pages.

## What you can do

- Edit the built-in glitch preset and see changes instantly in the live canvas
- Remix sketches with console logging, theme-aware UI, and optional auto-run
- Publish captured frames directly to Bluesky with CC-BY-SA licensing helpers
- Browse the `#meshArchive` community feed without leaving the workspace

## Start here

1. Open the studio at `http://localhost:3000` (or your deployed URL) on a desktop-sized screen.
2. Read the [IDE Guide](ide-guide.md) for an interface tour and troubleshooting tips.
3. Follow the [Remix Playbook](creative-remix-playbook.md) to establish a remix workflow.
4. Dive into hands-on tutorials:
   - [Tutorial 01: Remix the Glitch Preset](tutorials/01-remix-the-glitch-preset.md)
   - [Tutorial 02: Animate and Perform a Sketch](tutorials/02-live-interaction.md)
   - [Tutorial 03: Build Live Controls](tutorials/03-dynamic-controls.md)
   - [Tutorial 04: Source Images with Picsum and Custom Assets](tutorials/04-archive-ready-export.md)

## Publishing to Bluesky

See the [IDE Guide](ide-guide.md#publishing-to-bluesky) for the full walkthrough.

Quick checklist:

- Ensure a sketch has run and a canvas is visible.
- Use a Bluesky app password, not your primary login.
- Add captions that describe the remix and include `#meshArchive` for the community archive.

## Keep exploring

- Share your findings in community channels or the `#meshArchive` feed.
- Contribute new tutorials by adding markdown files inside `docs/tutorials/`.
- Report issues or ideas through GitHub discussions or issues.

If you are hosting this documentation with GitHub Pages, update project settings (`Settings -> Pages -> Source: docs/`) so `docs/index.md` becomes the landing page.
